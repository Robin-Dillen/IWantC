# This is a proof of concept library to provide C strictness in python

It's functionalities are:

- const static variables
- everything must be declared in \_\_init\_\_ (constructor)
- public, protected and private functions
- no monky patching
- maybe some more in the future

**disclaimer: this library is not meant to be used in production. It's also quite hacky sometimes**
